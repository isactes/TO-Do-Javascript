  <h1>Use a Switch Statement to Handle Multiple Actions</h1>
  <p>
    You can tell the Redux store how to handle multiple action types. Say you are managing user authentication in your
    Redux store. You want to have a state representation for when users are logged in and when they are logged out. You
    represent this with a single state object with the property authenticated. You also need action creators that create
    actions corresponding to user login and user logout, along with the action objects themselves.

    The code editor has a store, actions, and action creators set up for you. Fill in the reducer function to handle
    multiple authentication actions. Use a JavaScript switch statement in the reducer to respond to different action
    events. This is a standard pattern in writing Redux reducers. The switch statement should switch over action.type
    and return the appropriate authentication state.

    Note: At this point, don't worry about state immutability, since it is small and simple in this example. For each
    action, you can return a new object — for example, {authenticated: true}. Also, don't forget to write a default case
    in your switch statement that returns the current state. This is important because once your app has multiple
    reducers, they are all run any time an action dispatch is made, even when the action isn't related to that reducer.
    In such a case, you want to make sure that you return the current state.

    const defaultState = {
      authenticated: false
    };

    const authReducer = (state = defaultState, action) => {
      // Change code below this line
      switch (true) {
        case (action.type === 'LOGIN'):
          return { authenticated: true }
          break
        case (action.type === 'LOGOUT'):
          return { authenticated: false }
          break
        default:
          return state
          break
      }
      // Change code above this line
    };

    const store = Redux.createStore(authReducer);

    const loginUser = () => {
      return {
        type: 'LOGIN'
      }
    };

    const logoutUser = () => {
      return {
        type: 'LOGOUT'
      }
    };
  </script>
